1. I found the finding of long and lat from WAY -> "nd ref" is cost so much time, which is due to reading the whole 
file again and again. But if, its possible to make some indexing of a file, perhaps it would be easier.
Here comes, my idea, 
  1. Indexing of the file according line number, "nd ref" and "node id".
  2. Using linux head command concept to go to the indexed line number to start reading.
  3. End the readosm reading, before the next index line number.

Coming soon ....
