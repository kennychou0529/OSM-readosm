# OSM_dev
Many times I've seen a tv commercial of Auto as it taking voice command and replying geo-finding. For example, Driver 
is asking for "Restaurant" - and maybe it will reply result - 
"You have 5 restaurant wihtin 5 Km radius from your current position."

So, I was thinking to do the same. And ofcourse with a very little resource. My target is to port (if all succeed) it to 
Intel Galileo. After testing many, I found readosm is small and takes less resource.
