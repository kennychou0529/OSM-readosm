# OSM_dev
Many times I've seen a tv commercial of Auto as it taking voice command and replying geo-finding. For example, Driver 
is asking for "Restaurant" - and maybe it will reply result - 
"You have 5 restaurant wihtin 5 Km radius from your current position."

So, my idea is to do the same. with a small resources. My target is to port (if all succeed) it to 
Intel Galileo. After testing many, I found readosm is small and takes less resource.

My plan is to use Yocto in Galileo, so - once which running in any i386, would run there too.

All of these program, is on Ubuntu with Gcc - 4.8.2
